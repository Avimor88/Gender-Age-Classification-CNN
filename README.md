# Gender and Age Classification using CNNs
#########################################################
This is my final course projects for CSCI 8360 Data Science Practicum course. This project focuses on gender and age classification based on images. My work builds on the previous work:
 * Gil Levi & Tal Hassner Alexander, Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks. 2015
 * Ari Ekmekji. Convolutional Neural Networks for Age and Gender Classification, Stanford University. 2016
 
[1, 2] that has developed efficient architecture for such tasks. 
We are using the Reuters news articles corpus, which is a set of news articles split into several categories. There are multiple class labels per document, but we consider just the following class label
* CCAT: Corporate/Industrial
* ECAT: Economics
* GCAT: Government/Social
* MCAT: Markets
 
Goal was to build Naive Bayes classifier without using any existing libraries/packages like MLLib, ML or Scikit-Learn.
